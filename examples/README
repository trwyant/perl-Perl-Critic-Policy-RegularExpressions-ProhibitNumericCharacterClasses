This directory contains examples for the ProhibitNumericCharacterClasses
Perl-Critic policy. The files are:

README - This file.

devanagari.t - This is a demonstration, written in the form of a test,
    of the result of matching some character classes against non-ASCII
    digits, specifically "\N{DEVANAGARI DIGIT ONE}".

numeric-character-classes - This is a script that executes the
    ProhibitNumericCharacterClasses policy. It is more or less
    equivalent to
    $ perlcritic --single ProhibitNumericCharacterClasses
    but has its own configuration file. Use
    $ numeric-character-classes --help
    for the documentation.

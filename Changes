    Ignore \D etc except inside [^...]

    Configuration items to allow single-script classes.

    - If the allow_if_single_script Boolean item is true, \d and
      [:digit:] are allowed within the scope of (*script_run: ... ) or
      equivalent.
    - If the allow_if_singleton Boolean item is true, \d and [:digit:]
      are allowed if they are unquantified or quantified to 1 or less,
      AND if they are not followed by another \d or [:digit:]
    
    Collateral with this, I decided not to simply ban \d and [:digit:]
    in old-style bracketed character classes, but accept them if the
    character class also contains non-digit stuff.

    Add parameter allow_in_extended_character_class. This is an
    enumeration with values 'always', 'safe', and 'never'. The default
    is 'always'. The 'safe' value does a very simplistic analysis to see
    if the potentially-offending class is intersected with another class
    that restricts the intersection to ASCII or a subset thereof.

    Get dependencies up to snuff.

    Add examples/devanagari.t. This is a demonstration (in the form of
    a test) of the success or failure of various Perl character classes
    matching against "\N{DEVANAGARI DIGIT ONE}".

    Allow \d and [:digit:] in extended char classes.

    Search for negated classes as well.

    Add parameter allow_in_extended_character_class. This is an
    enumeration with values 'always', 'safe', and 'never'. The default
    is 'always'. The 'safe' value does a very simplistic analysis to see
    if the potentially-offending class is intersected with another class
    that restricts the intersection to ASCII or a subset thereof.

    Get dependencies up to snuff.

    Add examples/devanagari.t. This is a demonstration (in the form of
    a test) of the success or failure of various Perl character classes
    matching against "\N{DEVANAGARI DIGIT ONE}".

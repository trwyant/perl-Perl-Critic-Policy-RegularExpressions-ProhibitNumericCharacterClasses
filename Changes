    Add config_requires to metadata.

    Update xt/author/prereq.t to detect unused prereq

    Get prerequisites up to snuff and add xt/author/prereq.t to ensure
    they stay that way.

    Add Travis CI testing.

    Use GitHub as bug tracker. R.I.P. rt.cpan.org.

    Recode numeric-character-classes to allow options to specify
    configuration, rather than a configuration file.

    Found more quantifiers that specify at most one to wit: {0}, {0,0},
    and {1,1}

    Eliminate recommendation of Readonly::XS.

    Eliminate redirections in POD URL links

    Clean up and clarify POD. This actually involved some changes in
    ProhibitNumericCharacterClasses.run to ensure that what I said in
    the POD was actually true, and remained so.

    Test POD links.

    In examples/devanagari.t bring IsPosixDigit back to 5.8

    Update copyright to 2019.

    Fix broken POD links.

    Recognize \P{^...} as being same as \p{...} in extended character
    class analysis. This is not relevant elsewhere because of the
    presumption that if you are using Unicode properties you know what
    you are doing.

    Check for inverted unions and asymmetric difference in the extended
    character class analysis.

    Ignore \D etc except inside [^...]

    Configuration items to allow single-script classes.

    - If the allow_if_single_script Boolean item is true, \d and
      [:digit:] are allowed within the scope of (*script_run: ... ) or
      equivalent.
    - If the allow_if_singleton Boolean item is true, \d and [:digit:]
      are allowed if they are unquantified or quantified to 1 or less,
      AND if they are not followed by another \d or [:digit:]
    
    Collateral with this, I decided not to simply ban \d and [:digit:]
    in old-style bracketed character classes, but accept them if the
    character class also contains non-digit stuff.

    Add parameter allow_in_extended_character_class. This is an
    enumeration with values 'always', 'safe', and 'never'. The default
    is 'always'. The 'safe' value does a very simplistic analysis to see
    if the potentially-offending class is intersected with another class
    that restricts the intersection to ASCII or a subset thereof.

    Get dependencies up to snuff.

    Add examples/devanagari.t. This is a demonstration (in the form of
    a test) of the success or failure of various Perl character classes
    matching against "\N{DEVANAGARI DIGIT ONE}".

    Allow \d and [:digit:] in extended char classes.

    Search for negated classes as well.

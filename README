Copyright (C) 2018-2021 by Thomas R. Wyant, III

DESCRIPTION

This package contains a Perl::Critic policy to prohibit the Perl character
classes \d and [:digit:]. The rationale for this is that digit matching is
frequently a prelude to interpretation of a string as a number, but under at
least some conditions these classes match things other than ASCII digits.

Perl::Critic is a prerequisite for this package. It is the intent that
the prerequisites of this package be those of Perl::Critic, so no extra
stuff should be needed.

INSTALLATION

This package is installable by your favorite CPAN client, or by either of the
two usual incantations:

    tar -xzf \
	Perl-Critic-Policy-RegularExpressions-ProhibitNumericCharacterClasses-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    tar -xzf \
	Perl-Critic-Policy-RegularExpressions-ProhibitNumericCharacterClasses-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop the .pm
file into the Perl/Critic/Policy/RegularExpressions/ directory (creating it if
necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
